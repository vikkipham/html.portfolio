  I have several identities, and I am very proud of each and every one!
</p>

<p>My professors have taught me many valuable lessons in life:
  <ul>
    <li>It is better to set several small goals rather than one big one, after all, wherever you get will be where you need to be</li>
    <li>Be kind to yourself, you deserve the protection you give your friends!</li>
    <li>If someone is important to you but mistreats you, you don't want them in your life anyways!</li>
  </ul>
  I am so grateful for them, they are so amazing and I hold several things they tell me close to me as I navigate life
</p>

<p>
  In the future I hope to have a beautiful family and home and to do everything I love doing. Every day I appreciate life more and more and I am sure that this love of life will only grow stronger regardless of the ups and downs I will inevitably face
